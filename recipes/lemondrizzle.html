        <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition</li>
        <li>Sift in flour and baking powder gradually; fold with a wooden spoon to be sure flour is combined. Stir in lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan, being careful not to press it down</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <h4>To make the lemon glaze</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Juice the zested lemon from the cake batter into a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Add zest and juice of a second lemon</li>
